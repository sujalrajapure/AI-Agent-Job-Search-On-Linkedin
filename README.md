📌 Agentic AI — Autonomous Job Search & Application Bot

*   📊 Application Tracker: Keeps a log of applied jobs for easy follow-up.
    
*   🐳 Containerized: Uses Docker for easy deployment and environment consistency.
    

  
🛠️ Tech Stack

*   Python
    
*   BrowserUse (for web automation)
    
*   WebUI (for user interaction)
    
*   Docker (for packaging and deployment)
